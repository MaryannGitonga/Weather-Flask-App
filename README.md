# Weather-Flask-App
Weather App created using Flask which crawls the Open Weather Map API to read the weather reults of the city requested.

## Motivation
To refresh my knowledge on Flask and simple API integration

## Functionalities
User can search the name of the city of their choice. When submitted, the API returns: 
+ The name of the city
+ The temperature of the city
+ The temperature as perceived by a human
+ The weather desscription

## Things to Take Note
When creating this application, the API seemed to have an issue with the temperatures. The temperatures of some cities seemed to be faulty if verified with data from other sources.
